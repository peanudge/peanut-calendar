This is toy project for enhancing TDD with ReactJS.

Only focusig point is test coverage and good test code style.

I will start from a empty directory and begin building out our application, test by test. not using `create-react-app`

# Ground rules

> 1. with You Ain`t Need It(YAGNI) principle

> 2. Commit early and often

recommend committing to source control after every single tests.
